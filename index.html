        <br> <h1> Systemic Racism Is Real </h1>
        <br> <p> Systemic racism looks at the way racism operates over all of society, not just in one-on-one interactions.
      <br> It persists in our schools, offices, court system, police departments, and elsewhere.<p/>
        
        <br> <h2> Wealth </h2>
        <br> <p> According to one study, white families hold 90% of the national wealth, whereas black families only hold 2.6%. For every $100 white families earn in income, black families earn just $57.30. </p>
        
        <br> <h2> Employment </h2>
        <br> <p> The unemployment rate for black Americans have been consistently twice that of white Americans. According to data, black people with college degrees are twice as likely to be unemployed as all other graduates.</p>
        
        <br> <h2> Criminal Justice </h2>
        <br> <p> Although black people make up 13% of the population, they represent 40% of the prison population. If a black person and a white person each commit a crime, the black person has a better chance of being arrested. </p>
        <br> <h2> Housing </h2>
        <br> <p> The government, predatory lenders, and white homeowners worked together to actively segregate black Americans by harassment and preventing them from getting legitimate mortgages. Some of these measures include mobs forming to intimidate black families from moving into predominantly white communities and the FHA refusing to insure mortgages in and near African American neighborhoods.</p>
      
        <br> <h2> Healthcare </h2>
        <br> <p> A 2012 study found that a majority of doctors have “unconscious racial biases” when it comes to their black patients. Black Americans are also far more likely than white Americans to lack access to emergency medical care. </p>
